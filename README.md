# Undergrad Research and Projects Overview
The purpose of this repository is to host and archive elements of the various projects which I worked on during my studies as an undergraduate. As a general disclaimer a decent amount of the work and code here is relatively unrefined. If you are looking for projects which are more reflective of my current capabilities, I recommend you check out some of my other repositories which host personal projects as well as the work I have done in graduate classes. Thank you for your interest!

## Linear Algebra Project
Originally intended to be presented at KSC Academic Excellence Conference 2020 this project is an exploration of Google's traditional page rank algorithm, the prject was completed with the close oversight of our Linear Algebra professor. Included is an overview of the mathematics behind markov chains and random walks. We demonstrate the effects of markov chains with absorbing boundaries, circulatory boundaries, and chains with neither. Code was produced using matlab, files hosted here are the poster itself as well as the code used to generate the images.
